# PrestigeSociety Core (PSCore) 2015-2023

This prison core was coded from scratch and maintained by me (xBeastMode) for the PocketMine-MP (PMMP) server software.
It was coded for PrestigeSociety but later transferred to Euphoria Prison.
I had previously updated the entire core from PMMP 3.0 to 4.0, which took long months of work due to
all the breaking changes and my limited time.
PMMP updated once again to API 5.0 which broke the plugin once again, and I decide it to leave it there.<br><br>
For anyone without coding knowledge this core is pretty much useless since it was heavily adapted for Euphoria.<br>
If you have the knowledge to update and set this up for your server feel to. However, you may not modify it or distribute modified copies of it.
